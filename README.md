# search-query-anomaly-detection

This repository contains the solutions for various machine learning tasks as part of the AICP Internship. The tasks involve data analysis, visualization, clustering, anomaly detection, and more using Python and relevant libraries.

## Project Structure

- **data/**: Contains the dataset(s) used for the tasks.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks with step-by-step solutions.
- **scripts/**: Python scripts for specific tasks.
- **outputs/**: Generated visualizations and other output files.

## Tasks Overview

1. **Data Import and Cleaning**: Loading datasets, handling null values, and data preprocessing.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing data distributions, correlations, and trends.
3. **Clustering**: Applying KMeans and other clustering techniques to segment the data.
4. **Anomaly Detection**: Implementing Isolation Forest to identify outliers.
5. **Visualization**: Creating various plots (e.g., correlation matrices, word clouds) using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.
